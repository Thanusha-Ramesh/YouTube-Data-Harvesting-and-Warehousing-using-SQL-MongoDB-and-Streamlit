# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing-using-SQL-MongoDB-and-Streamlit
Introduction

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project aimed at developing a user-friendly Streamlit application that leverages the power of the Google API to extract valuable information from YouTube channels. The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database, subsequently migrated to a SQL data warehouse, and made accessible for analysis and exploration within the Streamlit app.
Some of the key features include:

Retrieve channel statistics: Get detailed information about YouTube channels, including subscriber count, view count, video count, and other relevant metrics.

Fetch video details: Extract data such as video title, description, duration, view count, like count, dislike count, and publish date for individual videos.

Analyze comments: Retrieve comments made on YouTube videos and perform analysis, such as sentiment analysis or comment sentiment distribution.

Generate reports: Generate reports and visualizations based on the collected data, allowing users to gain insights into channel performance, video engagement, and audience interaction.

Data storage: Store the collected YouTube data in a database for easy retrieval and future reference.
